Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

initializeCandidates():
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is number of candidates
Space Complexity: O(n)
Creates map and priority queue for candidates


castVote():
Time Complexity: O(log n) where n is the number of candidates
Space Complexity: O(1)
Involves removing and re-adding to priority queue


castRandomVote():
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is number of candidates in the election
Creating a map and priority queue, iterating through candidate list
Space Complexity: O(n)
n = number of candidates
Storing candidates in map and priority queue



castVote():
Time Complexity: O(n), where:
n = number of candidates in the election
Removing and re-adding an element requires scanning through all candidates
Space Complexity: O(1)
Constant extra space used, regardless of number of candidates



castRandomVote():
Time Complexity: O(n), where:
n = number of candidates in the election
Selecting a random candidate and casting vote is similar to castVote()
Space Complexity: O(1)
Constant extra space used for random selection



rigElection():
Time Complexity: O(p * n), where:
p = number of votes to rig
n = number of candidates in the election
Each vote requires scanning through candidates
Space Complexity: O(1)
Constant extra space used for rigging votes



getTopKCandidates():
Time Complexity: O(n + k log n), where:
n = number of candidates in the election
k = number of top candidates requested
Creating temporary heap is O(n)
Extracting top k candidates is O(k log n)
Space Complexity: O(k)
k = number of top candidates stored



auditElection():
Time Complexity: O(n log n), where:
n = number of candidates in the election
Creating temporary heap and extracting all candidates
Space Complexity: O(n)
n = number of candidates stored in temporary heap
